# WordPress VIP Go development for Docker

This repo provides a Docker-based network proxy for WordPress VIP Go
development. It is required to run WordPress VIP Go projects with [Docker for Wordpress VIP Go](https://github.com/kumarrajeevranjan/docker-wpcomvip).

## Set up

1. Clone or fork this repo.

2. Add `project.local` to your `/etc/hosts` file, where `project` is your desired domain name:

   ```
   127.0.0.1 localhost project.local
   ```
   Repeat this for every concurrent project you want to run under this nginx based proxy, e.g:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 localhost project.local
   127.0.0.1 localhost anotherproject.local
   ```

3. Copy `sample.env` to `.env` to provide domain names (same as in step 1), one domain per line.

4. Run `./bin/setup.sh`.

5. Run `docker network create nginx-proxy`.

6. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

6. Use ([Docker for Wordpress VIP Go](https://github.com/kumarrajeevranjan/docker-wpcomvip) to setup VIP Go projects.

## HTTPS support

This repo provide HTTPS support out of the box. The setup script generates
self-signed certificates for the domain specified in `.env`. To enforce the use
of HTTPS, comment out (or remove) `HTTPS_METHOD: "nohttps"` from the
`services/proxy/environment` section of `docker-compose.yml` in your VIP Go project folder.

You may wish to add the generated root certificate to your systemâ€™s trusted root
certificates. This will allow you to browse your dev environment over HTTPS
without accepting a browser security warning. On OS X:

```sh
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain certs/ca-root/ca.crt
```

## Troubleshooting

If your stack is not responding, the most likely cause is that a container has
stopped or failed to start. Check to see if all of the containers are "Up":

```
docker-compose ps
```

If not, inspect the logs for that container:

```
docker-compose logs nginx-proxy
```

If your self-signed certs have expired (`ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID`), simply delete
the `certs/self-signed` directory, stop docker-compose, run `./bin/setup.sh`, and restart
the stack.

If you wish to remove this external network, run:

```
docker-compose down && docker network prune
```
